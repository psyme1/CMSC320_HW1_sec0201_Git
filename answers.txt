Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: If your laptop breaks, or got infected with a virus, you would still be able to access the files from other devices.
Not only does it make it safer, as not all your files are saved purely to a single device, but also it makes it easier ot collaborate with other people on a project.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be very effectively used in political science. Giving politicians a better understanding of what the voters care about could increase their reponsitivity to the voters.
Also, that knowledge could be critical in showing which politicians are in the lead coming up to election days.
