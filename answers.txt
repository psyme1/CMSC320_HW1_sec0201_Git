Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: If your laptop breaks, or got infected with a virus, you would still be able to access the files from other devices.
Not only does it make it safer, as not all your files are saved purely to a single device, but also it makes it easier ot collaborate with other people on a project.
